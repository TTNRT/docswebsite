## Information
The following sections below will dictate on what you should know when making contributions to any of our projects on GitHub or TTGit. If you are doing either of these, please read the section that corresponds to the action you are doing. Ensure that you understand the actions that may be taken if you don’t follow the section guidelines or what will happen if you do afterwards.

## Creating issues in GitHub or TTGit
Many of our projects that we allow to be seen by others online have an issue system included with them. Some examples of having this system are as follows:

* The documentation website source code repository
* The “TTCloud” source code repository

If you are going to create an issue in either of these, then you should use the templates provided with them as they are helpful at organizing the issue and the problem all together. It is okay to use a blank template, but we recommend using the provided template included with the repository for the most part.

## Creating a pull request in GitHub or TTGit
If you don’t know what a pull request is or what it means, it’s a method of pushing something to a repository. It’s kind of like saying, “I would like to request a change to this”, but in a more different definition. For a pull request to be accepted and approved, you need to make sure of the following.

* Your changes needs to be appropriate and understandable for whatever you changed
* Your pull request has to have a reason for the change and if it’s a duplicate request from someone else
* You have pulled the repository to your own account and have it public for us to see it
* If there is a workflow inside the repository, wait for it to complete. You are allowed to delete the workflow from your version of the repository.
* Have common sense and respect for our other contributors that request something from you.
* When someone asks for a change in any part of the code, please do it and review your changes. Only do this if something doesn’t look right.

Once you have a pull request created, you won’t be able to push your changes to the repository. Wait for someone that is a moderator to approve your request before you can push your changes. You may need to wait for some time if it takes longer for someone to see your request.

## Handling commits in GitHub or TTGit
If you don’t know what a commit is or what it means, it’s a word for what you changed in any part of your repository. When you push a commit, the commit is logged to the repository and is able to be seen by everyone that is part of the repository or when they're not logged in. For pushing a commit, you need to know the following.

* Having a message that is reasonable and understandable for us to know on what you changed
* Describing what you changed or added using a list of changes/additions

Once you have pushed your commit to the repository, your changes will be visible to whatever part of the repository you made changes to. However, this does not mean that other users can push to the repository if they don’t have the necessary permissions to do it. If someone wants to push something to a repository that someone else owns, the person that owns the repository needs to add them as a contributor so that they can push their commit.

## Requirements
The requirements for creating an issue goes back to the feedback section included in the Terms of Use. Since most of these projects are hosted on GitHub, you should follow their terms of use and guidelines when you are using their website. We do not have any ownership over GitHub, so you should follow their terms and conditions when you have an account over there. Our guidelines still apply when you contribute to our TTGit projects.
