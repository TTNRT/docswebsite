title: Sending feedback
---

We use the feedback form system to allow users to report any issues or website problems that they may see. However, the system does come with limitations and restrictions that you need to be aware of before and after you submit any kind of feedback to us. This applies to when using the form system or via our support email address.

## Uploading screenshots
While we do allow users to upload a screenshot of their issue, keep in mind that any image that you upload will be checked and verified with the service it’s targeting. For example, when you send a screenshot of a HTML dropdown not aligning with a mobile device view, then we would have to check for ourselves. If that is the case, then we would send an update to the person that sent the feedback with what we will change and see if that fixed the issue.

Remember that it’s optional to upload a screenshot, but it’s recommended to do so because it helps us better understand the problem and to check if the issue is present to us.

## Describing your issue/problem
When you're describing the problem you’re facing, it’s important to have detailed information about the issue itself and if you were able to resolve the issue or not. Here’s what you should at least include in your description.

* When did the issue occur
* What site or service did you see this issue on
* If you were able to reproduce the issue or not
* What device you noticed the issue on (examples are below)
    * On a mobile device
    * On a computer

You should also check for the following as well

* Any spelling errors
* Any grammar mistakes
* Where you should have punctuation

If any of these requirements are not met after you submit your issue, your feedback will be denied. Make sure you use some common sense in your description so that we can understand your problem better. Note that if you have any spelling errors or grammar mistakes, your feedback will still be accepted, regardless of any of the checks above, but you should still check for any of them.
