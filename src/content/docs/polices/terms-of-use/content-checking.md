title: Content checking
---
Content checking is a process if there is either offensive or explicit content on a person's account. TTNRT does not allow **any 18+ related content** on all of our services. The list below is what kind of content is not allowed.

* Nudey  
* Links to adult sites  
* 18+ related profile picture  
* Username having offensive words (including swearing, racial, or other offensive words)

Some of these can be found in a user's:

* Username  
* Full name  
* Email address  
* Profile picture

If any of these are spotted, the account that is linked to them will be purged, which may include an email being sent to the person who owns it. It’s important to not have any explicit content, even if it's just for fun or for playing a practical joke. We take this rule very seriously, so please respect it while you use our services!

## How we handle potential bot accounts
Bot detection is a process where an account on any of our services is being flagged as a bot account because of their activity and their account information. Having bot accounts on any of our services isn’t allowed because if too many are being created, our database won’t have more space to allow newer users to sign up for that service. Accounts can be flagged as a bot account by their:

* Email address  
* Username  
* Full name (first and last name)  
* Profile picture  
* Biography (if it contains any suspicious links)

Keep in mind that this list is not comprehensive or accurate enough to fully determine if an account is a bot, so you should look out for any signs by looking at their account information. If you do see a user that is acting like a bot would, send us an email to our support team so we can remove that user from the service you reported them on.
