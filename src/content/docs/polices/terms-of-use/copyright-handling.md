If you are willing to host our logo on your website, such as when you are a partner with us or something of that nature, you are welcome to host it, but you are not permitted to edit, modify, or alter the image in any way you like. Our logo is protected by copyright law, so if you choose to modify it and host it on your website without our permission, we will submit a DMCA strike on your website and you will be required to remove it after we send our complaint. You are also required to have some kind of attribution footer that is linked to the logo so that we know you have given permission to host it.
