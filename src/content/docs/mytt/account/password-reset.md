title: Resetting your password
---
This page will go over the password reset process for your myTT account.

## Information
When you request to have your password reset, you have to make sure you have it changed to a more secure one that you can remember. Creating password should be at least 8 characters long or more, along with having a symbol, or number in it.

:::caution
Please understand the risks you are taking when resetting it. The password will be simple and easier to enter once it's pushed to your account. If you don't reset it to a more secure one, you might have your account disabled to prevent anyone from getting into your personal data. Always have the basic general requirements when creating a new password. Don't use the same password you have used previously.

## The process
Once you send a request to the support team, they will add in a temporary password to your account, so that you can login again. Once done, the team will respond and give you the password for you to login. After you are logged in, you should change your password to a secure one that you can remember, and not using the last password you have used previously. If you didn't change it in time or didn't need to, your account may be disabled. This is only to prevent anyone from logging in without your consent. As normal, the password is hashed once pushed to make it harder to crack or decode.

## Side notes
Your request is not always seen by the support team, so you should give them some time to find it. It's important to give them some time to help out with your account. Please don't send too many requests, you might be rate limited or they might not help you at all!
