description: Our guide to adding a banner code for your mytt profile

Currently, the user banner only uses color codes. If you need to grab a color code, you can lookup tools that can give you a color code, or by using our color grab tool in the "Tools" page. By default, there is no banner set when you create your account, and is only an optional feature. To change your banner color, go to your account settings and find where the profile section is located. Type in any color code into the form. 

Ensure that the code is in HEX format, and has the hashtag in front of it. Once you have committed your changes, your banner color will be visible on your user profile page. If you want to remove your banner color, go back to the account settings page and locate the profile section. Remove the content from the form and commit your changes. When you go back to your profile page, your banner color will be nothing but a black color.
