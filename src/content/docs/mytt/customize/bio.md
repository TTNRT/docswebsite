description: Our guide to adding a bio for your mytt profile
---
Think of a bio about who you are, your interests, what you like or to do, or anything in general. When you have a bio, all of the information from it will be displayed publicly to everyone, including those that are not logged in. We use Markdown-it to assist with formatting your bio, along with some additional extensions you might also need with it.

To add your bio, go to your account settings, and find where the profile section is located. The bio form consists of a editor and preview tab. The editor tab is where your bio goes, and the preview tab is to preview what your bio will look like. Once you have your bio information, submit the form to commit your changes. Your bio information will be displayed on your profile page after you commit your changes.

Should you want to remove your bio, you can simply delete the content from it by editing it in your account settings. Your profile will longer show your bio data after you commit your changes. Additionally, you can change your privacy settings to prevent other users from looking at your bio. See the privacy settings document for more information on what you can set.
