title: Customizing your profile
---

This page will go over customizing your profile for your myTT account

## What you can add
You may think that we have a limited number of additions for adding to your profile page, and this is true. We know that myTT is a work in progress, and should be treated like that. Here are some profile additions you can add to your profile page.

- Bio (uses Markdown for easier writing)
- Banner color

Note that this list may be updated if something new comes in. Check back here for anything new!

## Adding a bio
Think of a bio about who you are, your interests, what you like or to do, or anything in general. When you have a bio, all of the information from it will be displayed publicly to everyone, including those that are not logged in. We use Markdown-it to assist with formatting your bio, along with some additional extensions you might also need with it.

To add your bio, go to your account settings, and find where the profile section is located. The bio form consists of a editor and preview tab. The editor tab is where your bio goes, and the preview tab is to preview what your bio will look like. Once you have your bio information, submit the form to commit your changes. Your bio information will be displayed on your profile page after you commit your changes.

Should you want to remove your bio, you can simply delete the content from it by editing it in your account settings. Your profile will longer show your bio data after you commit your changes. Additionally, you can change your privacy settings to prevent other users from looking at your bio. See the privacy settings document for more information on what you can set.

## Adding a banner
Currently, the user banner only uses color codes. If you need to grab a color code, you can lookup tools that can give you a color code, or by using our color grab tool in the "Tools" page. By default, there is no banner set when you create your account, and is only an optional feature. To change your banner color, go to your account settings and find where the profile section is located. Type in any color code into the form. Ensure that the code is in HEX format, and has the hashtag in front of it. Once you have committed your changes, your banner color will be visible on your user profile page. If you want to remove your banner color, go back to the account settings page and locate the profile section. Remove the content from the form and commit your changes. When you go back to your profile page, your banner color will be nothing but a black color.
