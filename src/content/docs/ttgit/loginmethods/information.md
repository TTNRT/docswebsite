For the most part, we use the default username and password login method. However, we offer additional methods of logging in to your account. Some providers that we use can be as follows:

- Google
- GitHub

:::note
In order to connect these methods to your account, you need to have an existing account that has a username and password as a backup method of logging in. If you are signing up with one these methods, you will need to create an account in order to link these. Note that you won't be able to change how you want to login, such as changing back to using your username and password. Should you want to change on how you want to login, please reach out to our support team!
