## General requirements
To get started with this service, you should have:

1. A TTGit account
2. Static files (only HTML-based!)

## Setting up your repository
To start off, create your repository. You should have the following information for it below.

- Name: `<subdomain>.ttnrtsite.io` or other name (see option 1)
- Branch: `pages`
- Topic: `pages`

## Additonal information
This section has two options that you can pick from, depending on how you want your site to display or how you are building it. In additon, your website URL will be determined by whatever method you used to deploy it.

If you used the first method, your website URL will be `https://<owner>.ttnrtsite.io/<reponame>/`. If you used the second method, your website URL will be `https://<owner>.ttnrtsite.io/`.

The `owner` variable is your account username, while the `reponame` variable is the repository name where your website data is located. As for the `path` variable, it's only needed if you have another directory containing a `index.html` file.

## Deployment methods

### Method 1: Subpage version
<Steps>

1. Create your repo with any name you like. The repo should have a `pages` branch, along with the `pages` topic appiled to it.
2. Upload your website data to the `pages` branch. Your files should only be static-based and nothing else!
3. Your site should work when you use the URL that is stated in the [Additonal information](#additonal-information) section!

</Steps>

### Method 2: Non-subpage version
<Steps>

1. Create your repo, but with a name like this: `<owner>.ttnrtsite.io`. The repo should also have a `pages` branch, along with the `pages` topic appiled to it.
2. Upload your website data to the `pages` branch. Your files should only be static-based and nothing else!
3. Your site should work when you use the URL that is stated in the [Additonal information](#additonal-information) section!

</Steps>

### Method 3: Using the CI interface
:::note
This method requires you to either have the actions or Woodpecker CI setup with your repository. If you are going to use the Woodpecker CI interface, you need to request access to it. To learn more about it, please see this [page](/ttgit/actions/woodpecker) for more information about it and how to request access to it. The Gitea actions method will depend on how you set it up, and as such, some of the steps that will cover it may not be accurate enough. Please let us know if their is a mistake in any of the steps for it.

<Steps>

1. Create your repo by using one of the methods above. The repo should also have a `pages` branch, along with the `pages` topic appiled to it.
2. Upload your website data and have your woodpecker workflow file included. Make sure that the file is located in the root directory.
3. Configure your workflow file. If you need some examples on how it should look like, please refer to this [page](/ttpages/deployment-configs). If you already have it prepared, you are free to skip to the next steps.
4. Commit your changes and check if the workflow is running. If it's not running, you may need to add your repository it the system. Please refer to this [page](/ttgit/actions/woodpecke)
5. Your site should work when you use the URL that is stated in the [Additonal information](#additonal-information) section!
