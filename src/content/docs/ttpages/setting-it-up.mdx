## General requirements
To get started with this service, you should have:

1. A TTGit account
2. Static files (only HTML-based!)

## Setting up your repository
To start off, create your repository. You should have the following information for it below.

- Name: `<subdomain>.ttnrtsite.io` or other name (see option 1)
- Branch: `pages`
- Topic: `pages`

## Additional information
This section has two options that you can pick from, depending on how you want your site to display or how you are building it. In addition, your website URL will be determined by whatever method you used to deploy it.

If you used the first method, your website URL will be `https://<owner>.ttnrtsite.io/<reponame>/`. If you used the second method, your website URL will be `https://<owner>.ttnrtsite.io/`.

The `owner` variable is your account username, while the `reponame` variable is the repository name where your website data is located. As for the `path` variable, it's only needed if you have another directory containing a `index.html` file.

## Deployment methods

### Method 1: Subpage version
<Steps>

1. Create your repo with any name you like. The repo should have a `pages` branch, along with the `pages` topic appiled to it.
2. Upload your website data to the `pages` branch. Your files should only be static-based and nothing else!
3. Your site should work when you use the URL that is stated in the [Additional information](#additonal-information) section!

</Steps>

### Method 2: Non-subpage version
<Steps>

1. Create your repo, but with a name like this: `<owner>.ttnrtsite.io`. The repo should also have a `pages` branch, along with the `pages` topic applied to it.
2. Upload your website data to the `pages` branch. Your files should only be static-based and nothing else!
3. Your site should work when you use the URL that is stated in the [Additional information](#additonal-information) section!

</Steps>
