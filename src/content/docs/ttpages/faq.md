description: If you have any questions reguarding TTPages, here are some you might ask us about
---

> Q: What is it about?
>
> A: It's all about hosting static sites using TTGit's API and backend.

> Q: How does it work?
>
> A: The system works as a normal web serve would, however it gathers data from TTGit in order to display whatever data you are requesting from it. The program is written in GoLang and is proxyed through nginx via our Midwest server.

> Q: Is there support for custom domains?
>
> A: No. The code that is used for the software has no support for it at this time.

> Q: Can I use static site generators with it?
>
> A: Right now, testing for that is not ready at this time. However, if you are willing to use any of them, we recommand using our Woodpecker CI as it's more easier to deploy your website.
