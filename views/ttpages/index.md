# Quick start

Follow this quick start guide to get your site up and running with TTPages.

## General requirements

To get started with this service, you should have:

1. A TTGit account
2. Static files (only HTML-based!)

## Setting up your repository

To start off, create your repository. You should have the following information for it below.

- Name: `<subdomain>.ttnrtsite.io` or other name (see option 1)
- Branch: `pages`
- Topic: `pages`

This section has two options that you can pick from, depending on your setup.

### Option one

Create your repo with any name you like. The repo should have a `pages` branch, along with the `pages` topic. Once you created the repo, you may upload your static data to it. Once done, go to this URL in this form. `https://<owner>.ttnrtsite.io/<reponame>/<path>`

- Reponame is your repository name
- Owner is your username

### Option two

Create your repo, but with a name like this. `<owner>.ttnrtsite.io`. The repo should also have a `pages` branch, along with the `pages` topic. Once you created the repo, you may upload your static data to it. Once done, go to this URL in this form. `https://<owner>.ttnrtsite.io/`
